          and provides new features and major gains in performance.
          It is not primarily intended to be written by hand,
          rather it is designed to be an effective compilation target for low-level source languages like C,
          C++, Rust, etc.</section>

            <p class="slide__div__p">In 2008, a period that people call the performance wars began. Multiple
              browsers added just-in-time
              compilers, also called JITs. As JavaScript was running, the JIT could see patterns and make the code run
              faster based on those patterns.

              The introduction of these JITs led to an inflection point in the performance of JavaScript. Execution of
              JS was 10x faster.</p>

            <p class="slide__div__p">To make JITs They added a new part to the JavaScript engine, called a
              monitor.That monitor watches the code as it runs, and makes a note of how many times it is run and what
              types are used.
              At first, the monitor just runs everything through the interpreter.</p>

            <p class="slide__div__p">When a function starts getting warm(If the same lines of code are run a few
              times), the JIT will send it off to be compiled.
              Then it will store that compilation. If the monitor sees
              that execution is hitting the same code again with the same variable types, it will just pull out its
              compiled version. </p>

              will send it off to the
              optimizing compiler. This will create another, even faster, version of the function that will also be

          <div class="slide__div">
            <p class="slide__div__p">In order to make a faster version of the code, the optimizing compiler has to
              make some assumptions.
              For example, if it can assume that all objects created by a particular constructor have the same
              shape—that is, that they always have the same property names, and that those properties were added in the
              same order— then it can cut some corners based on that.</p>

              objects that all have the same shape, but then the 100th might be missing a property.
              So the compiled code needs to check before it runs to see whether the assumptions are valid. If they are,
              then the compiled code runs. But if not, the JIT assumes that it made the wrong assumptions and trashes
              the optimized code.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p class="slide__div__p">Even with these improvements, though, the performance of JavaScript can be
            unpredictable. And to make things faster, the JIT has added some overhead during runtime, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>optimization and deoptimization</li>
            <li>memory used for the monitor’s bookkeeping and recovery information for when bailouts happen</li>
            <li>memory used to store baseline and optimized versions of a function</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="slide__div__p">There’s room for improvement here: that overhead could be removed, making performance
            more predictable. And that’s one of the things that WebAssembly does.

            Once it reaches the browser, JavaScript source gets parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree.
          </p>
          <p class="slide__div__p">
            Browsers often do this lazily, only parsing what they really need to at first and just creating stubs for
            functions which haven’t been called yet.
          </p>
          <p class="slide__div__p">
            From there, the AST is converted to an intermediate representation (called bytecode) that is specific to
            that JS engine.

            In contrast, WebAssembly doesn’t need to go through this transformation because it is already an

            in it.

          </p>
          <p class="slide__div__p">
            This happens when assumptions that the JIT makes based on running code turn out to be incorrect.
          </p>
          <p class="slide__div__p">
            There are two costs to deoptimization. First, it takes some time to bail out of the optimized code and go
            back to the baseline version. Second, if that function is still being called a lot, the JIT may decide to
            send it through the optimizing compiler again, so there’s the cost of compiling it a second time

          <p class="slide__div__p">
            It is possible to write JavaScript that executes performantly. To do it, you need to know about the
            optimizations that the JIT makes.
          </p>
          <p class="slide__div__p">
            However, most developers don’t know about JIT internals. Even for those developers who do know about JIT
            internals, it can be hard to hit the sweet spot.
          </p>
          <p class="slide__div__p">
            Plus, the optimizations a JIT uses are different between browsers, so coding to the internals of one browser
            can make your code less performant in another.

        <section class="slide__4__10">

            Because of this, executing code in WebAssembly is generally faster. Many of the optimizations that JITs make

          <p class="slide__div__p">
            In JavaScript, the developer doesn’t have to worry about clearing out old variables from memory when they
            aren’t needed anymore. Instead, the JS engine does that automatically using something called a garbage
            collector.
          </p>
          <p class="slide__div__p">
            This can be a problem if you want predictable performance, though. You don’t control when the garbage
            collector does its work, so it may come at an inconvenient time. Most browsers have gotten pretty good at
            scheduling it, but it’s still overhead that can get in the way of your code’s execution.

            WebAssembly does not support garbage collection at all. Memory is managed manually (as it is in languages

            performance more consistent.
